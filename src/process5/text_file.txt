# PROCESS 5 - WATCHDOG

## THE AIM OF THE WATCHDOG :

	In this project the watchdog is used to check
	the previous 4 processes periodically, 
	and sends a reset (like the R button of the 
	inspection console) in case all processes did nothing 
	(no computation, no motion, no input/output) for
	60 seconds.
	
## HOW IT WORKS : 

	This process uses several Signals for implementing
	the communication with the other four processes.
	
	### PROCESS STILL ACTIVE NOTIFICATIONS :
   	
		In order to check if the other four processes are
		still active, the watchdog receives signals from
		the other processes in order to know that at least
		one of them is still active.
		It handles the signals using the signal handler function
		that reset the timer at its initial value (60 seconds).
   	
 	### ALARM : 
   
		When the timer goes to zero, it means that the four 
		processes aren't active from 60 seconds, so the watchdog 
		sends an allarm signal (using the kill system call) 
		that has the same effect of the reset button.
		To do this the watchdog needs the pid of the all processes 
		(because the system call KILL, that send the signal, needs 
		the process receiving pid as first argument) so firstly we 
		is created a temporary text file, that contains all the 
		pid of processes, and lastly an array that takes all pid 
		in order to the watchdog can take all pid.
