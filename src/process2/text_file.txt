# PROCESS 2 - INSPECTION CONSOLE 


## THE AIM OF INSPECTION CONSOLE :

	In this project the inspection console is 
	used for two purposes :
	
	* To receive from motors the hoist positions 
	  while it is moving, and reporting them on the 
	  screen
	
	* To manage the Stop and the Reset 
	  buttons
	
## HOW IT WORKS : 

	This process uses a combination of SIGNALS and 
	NAMED PIPE for implementing the communication 
	with the Motor X and Motor Z processes whereas it
	uses only SIGNAL to communicate with the watchdog 
	process and to implement the Stop button.
	
   ### STOP AND RESET BUTTONS :
      
       To send the commands received by the user 
       (that can be S for the stop button and R for 
       the reset button) to the two motor processes, 
       the inspection consol sends 
       a signal to the both motors ,to warn them that 
       the user has pushed the Reset button or the Stop
       button.
       To do this the inspection console needs the pid of 
       the motor processes (because the system call KILL
       ,that send the signal, needs the process receiving
       pid as first argument) so firstly we have created 
       a temporary text file ,that contains all the pid of 
       processes, and lastly an array that takes all pid 
       in order to the inspection console can choose the 
       proper pid that it needs.
       For the Reset button after sending the signal the 
       inspection console open a named pipe and write the 
       reset command,taken in input, using the write() 
       system call.
       For the Stop button, instead, the inspection console
       just send the signal (without named pipe) with the 
       system call kill() (because is mandatory to manage 
       the stop/emergency button only with a signal).
       
   ### COMMUNICATION WITH MOTORS :
   
   	The motors have to send ,to the ispection console 
   	, the hoist positions (while it is moving) and the 
   	ispection console has to reporting them on the screen.
   	To do this we use Signals, so the ispection console 
   	catch the signal (with the signal system call) when 
   	the motor has written the position and with a specific 
   	signal handler, read the position using the named pipe
   	and reports the position on the screen.
   	
   ### COMMUNICATION WITH WATCHDOG :
      
       When the inspection console receives a Reset or Stop
       command in input and when it receives the hoist positions
       from the motors, sends a signal to the watchdog in 
       order to warn it that it is still active.
       Instead, when the inspection console and the other 
       processes are not active for 60 seconds, the inspection
       console catch the alarm signal sent by watchdog and 
       through the signal_handler function it handles the 
       alarm signal.
